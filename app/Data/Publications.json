This announcement is more than a procedural update—it represents a structural shift in the way financial services will be delivered in one of South Asia’s most densely populated and economically dynamic countries.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Bangladesh’s push toward digital banking comes at a time when financial access remains uneven: only 28.3 percent of adults held an account with a bank or non-bank financial institution in 2023, leaving roughly three out of four adults unbanked. Internet penetration, while improving, stood at 44.5 percent in January 2025, with around 77.7 million users, and the number of active SIM cards reached 188.9 million by July 2025. These indicators highlight both the opportunities and challenges facing digital banks—broad mobile reach but still limited connectivity and financial access.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">The new licensing regime aims to harness this digital momentum. By reducing reliance on costly branch networks and leveraging mobile and internet penetration, digital banks are expected to lower transaction costs, expand outreach into rural areas, and improve access to savings, credit, and insurance. In short, Bangladesh Bank’s initiative is not only about modernizing banking—it is about redefining financial inclusion for a new era.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">Historical Context and Challenges</h2>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">The State of Financial Inclusion</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Bangladesh has made progress in expanding financial services, but the gaps remain stark. According to surveys from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, only 32 percent of men and 25 percent of women held formal bank accounts in 2023. Rural populations are disproportionately excluded, with 54.4 percent of the unbanked living outside urban areas. These figures illustrate why policymakers have prioritized inclusive digital banking: traditional banks have struggled to overcome geographic and socioeconomic barriers.</p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Infrastructure and Digital Divide</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Although mobile phone penetration is near-universal, internet access remains patchy. In July 2025, Bangladesh reported 135.99 million internet subscribers, most of them mobile users, but connectivity in rural regions is weaker, and smartphone affordability is still an obstacle. Digital literacy also lags, particularly among women and older populations.</p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Cybersecurity Concerns</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Rapid digital adoption has also exposed vulnerabilities. Fraudulent SIM swaps, phishing scams, and weak security in some mobile financial service (MFS) platforms have led to growing consumer distrust. Without strong frameworks for data protection and dispute resolution, scaling digital services has been fraught with risks.</p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Lessons from the Pandemic</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">The COVID-19 pandemic underscored both the necessity and fragility of digital finance. Mobile financial service use increased by nearly 40 percent during the pandemic years, but gaps in interoperability, limited service offerings, and security weaknesses highlighted the urgent need for regulatory reform. The new guidelines directly respond to these lessons, embedding stronger requirements for technology, governance, and customer protection.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">Core Features of the Licensing Framework</h2>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Capital and Governance Requirements</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Bangladesh Bank’s new rules require digital banks to demonstrate financial resilience through robust minimum paid-up capital thresholds. This ensures that only serious, well-funded entities can enter the market, reducing risks of collapse. Governance requirements are equally stringent: boards must include members with proven expertise in technology and finance, and institutions will be held to strict standards of transparency and accountability.</p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Technology Integration</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Digital banks must integrate electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC) systems linked to the national identity database. This will speed up onboarding while cutting costs and fraud risks. Institutions are also expected to adopt artificial intelligence and big data analytics for credit scoring, fraud detection, and customer service.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Cloud banking and API-driven systems will be required to ensure interoperability with mobile operators, fintechs, and other banks. The guidelines also encourage the use of blockchain or distributed ledger systems for transaction security, a forward-looking step for the sector.</p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Cybersecurity and Risk Management</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Given Bangladesh’s experiences with MFS fraud, cybersecurity is central to the framework. Licensed digital banks will have to implement end-to-end encryption, multifactor authentication, real-time monitoring, and regular penetration testing. They will also be subject to mandatory reporting of breaches and audits against global standards such as ISO 27001.</p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Inclusive Services</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Perhaps the most important provision is the mandate to extend services to rural and underserved populations. Digital banks must go beyond payments to offer microloans, affordable savings products, and micro-insurance. Special attention is directed toward small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and women entrepreneurs, who often face the steepest barriers in accessing formal credit. By explicitly linking licensing to inclusion, Bangladesh Bank is attempting to ensure that digital banking contributes to national development rather than simply urban convenience.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">Case Studies and Pilot Projects in Bangladesh</h2>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">The promise of digital banking is not theoretical—Bangladesh already has examples of how digital finance can transform communities.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">BURO Bangladesh, a major microfinance institution, began piloting mobile financial services for its predominantly female client base. Women who once had to make weekly physical trips to repay loans or deposit savings were able to complete transactions via mobile wallets. This shift reduced costs, improved security, and gave women greater autonomy in managing their finances.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">In 2021, bKash and City Bank launched a pilot “Nano Loan” product that allowed bKash users to access small digital loans instantly. The product drew on transaction histories and digital identity for credit assessments, eliminating lengthy paperwork. For many users, it was their first experience of formal credit, demonstrating how digital innovation can fill critical gaps.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Similarly, Apon Wellbeing, a fintech targeting industrial workers, integrated credit, savings, and insurance services into a digital platform. By addressing the needs of low-income workers often excluded from formal systems, Apon showed the potential for specialized fintech models to complement banking initiatives.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">These pilots underline the central lesson: with the right mix of technology, trust, and regulatory support, digital finance can serve populations historically excluded from formal banking.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">International Benchmarks and Lessons</h2>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Global experience offers valuable lessons for Bangladesh’s digital banking rollout.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">In India, the creation of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) enabled seamless, low-cost transactions across multiple platforms. Coupled with Paytm’s scale, this created a vibrant digital ecosystem serving hundreds of millions. Bangladesh can learn from India’s regulatory commitment to interoperability and standardized payments.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Kenya’s M-Pesa remains the gold standard for financial inclusion in resource-constrained environments. By enabling mobile-based money transfers in a low-literacy, low-infrastructure context, M-Pesa brought millions into the financial system. For Bangladesh, where mobile subscriptions far outnumber bank accounts, the Kenyan example reinforces the importance of mobile-first models that work even without smartphones or high-speed internet.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">China’s WeBank shows the possibilities of a fully digital bank operating at scale. With over 200 million customers, WeBank leverages artificial intelligence, big data, and ecosystem partnerships to deliver a wide range of services efficiently. For Bangladesh, the lesson is clear: data-driven innovation, integrated with social and commercial ecosystems, can achieve massive scale without branches.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">To adapt these models locally, Bangladesh could adopt regulatory sandboxes to allow controlled testing of innovative products and encourage public-private partnerships between banks, mobile operators, and fintech startups.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">Conclusion and Outlook</h2>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Bangladesh’s decision to license digital banks represents a bold and timely step toward addressing one of its most pressing challenges: financial exclusion. With over 70 percent of adults unbanked, the opportunity is immense. Digital banks can empower farmers, small business owners, and women entrepreneurs, while also improving remittance flows and savings culture.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">However, the path forward will depend on consistent policy implementation, infrastructure investment, and consumer protection. Expanding rural internet coverage, ensuring affordable smartphones, and running national financial literacy campaigns will be essential. Cybersecurity, too, must remain at the forefront—consumer trust will make or break this transition.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Projections suggest that with sustained support, Bangladesh could achieve financial inclusion rates of 60–70 percent by 2030, nearly doubling the current level. If realized, this would not only improve household resilience but also unlock new sources of growth for the national economy.</p>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">As the September 2025 licensing window approaches, digital banking in Bangladesh is poised to become a model for emerging economies worldwide. The challenge now lies in turning regulatory vision into sustainable, inclusive practice. If successful, Bangladesh will not only bridge its own financial divide but could inspire a broader South Asian digital banking revolution.</p>\n\n</article>"

    "article": "<article class=\"max-w-5xl mt-10 mx-auto text-gray-800 \">\n\n  <h1 class=\"text-3xl font-bold mb-6\">Overview of Laws and Enforcement Hurdles</h1>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Bangladesh introduced the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 2023, replacing laws dating back to 1940 and 1982. The new act consolidates oversight under the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA), covering licensing, manufacturing, import, distribution, sale, storage, and advertising of drugs and cosmetics. It also requires strict compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and World Health Organization standards for production and distribution.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Despite the modernized framework, enforcement remains a challenge. Bangladesh has around 86 local pharmaceutical manufacturers that produce almost 98 percent of domestic demand, and more than 200,000 pharmacies nationwide. Regulating such a vast and fragmented supply chain requires more inspectors and stronger oversight.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">The rise of online and social media drug sales adds complexity. While e-pharmacies must be licensed, many unregistered vendors operate through Facebook, WhatsApp, and similar platforms. Reports suggest over 1,500 illegal online drug sellers are active, compared to only a handful of licensed e-pharmacies.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Judicial delays and weak enforcement further erode deterrence. Even when counterfeiters are caught, lengthy legal processes and modest penalties limit the impact. As a result, counterfeit and substandard medicines continue to penetrate the market. Estimates suggest that fake medicines may account for up to 20 percent of sales, worth hundreds of crores of taka annually. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that about 10 percent of medicines in low- and middle-income countries are falsified or substandard, showing the scale of the challenge.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">Recent Incidents and Reports (2024-2025)</h2>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Recent years have seen several high-profile seizures and alarming reports. In Dhaka, raids on Midford Market and other hubs have uncovered stockpiles of counterfeit antibiotics, painkillers, and cosmetic products. These operations revealed how widespread the problem is, especially in informal retail chains.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">A 2024 study on antibiotic use highlighted that more than two-thirds of antibiotics purchased online were misused, with patients often failing to complete prescribed courses. This not only reduces treatment effectiveness but also accelerates antimicrobial resistance. In rural areas, limited access to licensed pharmacies drives many people to buy drugs from unlicensed vendors or online sellers, where the risks of counterfeit products are highest.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Law enforcement has occasionally partnered with international organizations such as INTERPOL in regional crackdowns, but the challenge remains systemic: counterfeiters exploit weak oversight, fragmented supply chains, and consumer desperation.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">Risks to Industry and Nation</h2>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">The counterfeit drug trade poses risks that extend far beyond the immediate health dangers to patients.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Health risks are the most severe. Counterfeit medicines can cause treatment failure, prolonged illness, and in the worst cases, death. The misuse of substandard antibiotics contributes significantly to antimicrobial resistance, which is emerging as one of the greatest public health threats of this century.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Economic losses are also significant. The pharmaceutical industry—one of Bangladesh’s most important export sectors—faces revenue hits of 10 to 20 percent due to counterfeit competition. Fake products erode legitimate sales, reduce profit margins, and undermine export credibility.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Reputational damage is another consequence. International buyers and regulators may become hesitant to source from Bangladesh if counterfeit or substandard products are linked to its supply chains. This could jeopardize the country’s growing pharmaceutical exports, which are a source of national pride and economic growth.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Finally, public trust is undermined. If people believe that medicines are unsafe or unreliable, they may avoid seeking formal treatment or rely on unverified remedies, deepening health crises and increasing social costs.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">Legal Provisions and Punishments</h2>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Domestic Laws</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 2023 provides a strong legal foundation. It criminalizes the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit medicines. Licensing and registration requirements apply to manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers. Advertising and e-pharmacy sales are also regulated.</p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Punishments</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Severe penalties are available under the law. Counterfeiting can lead to cancellation of licenses, heavy fines, and imprisonment, with life sentences possible in extreme cases. However, enforcement and prosecution remain inconsistent, limiting the deterrent effect.</p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">Intellectual Property Laws</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Trademark laws also provide a legal avenue to combat counterfeit branding, labels, and packaging. Remedies include fines, imprisonment, and civil damages. However, IP enforcement tends to be slower, with limited coordination between drug regulators, customs, and IP authorities.</p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2\">International Standards</h3>\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Bangladesh can look to international models for inspiration. The Medicrime Convention sets clear standards for prosecuting medical product counterfeiting. The TRIPS Agreement provides minimum IP protection standards. The EU’s Falsified Medicines Directive mandates tamper-evident packaging and track-and-trace systems, while the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act enforces serialization and end-to-end supply chain visibility. These approaches show the importance of combining regulation, technology, and enforcement.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4\">Conclusion and Advisory</h2>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Counterfeit medicines remain a critical threat to health, industry, and trust in Bangladesh. While the 2023 Drugs and Cosmetics Act has laid the legal groundwork, stronger enforcement, technological integration, and international collaboration are urgently required.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Key steps forward include expanding the number of DGDA inspectors, adopting digital track-and-trace systems for drug packaging, cracking down on unlicensed e-pharmacies, and educating consumers about safe medicine use. Ratifying international conventions and aligning with global best practices would also strengthen Bangladesh’s credibility.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">For pharmaceutical companies and distributors, compliance is no longer optional—it is essential for survival. Legal experts such as Ahammad Jonaed & Partners can provide crucial support in navigating licensing, intellectual property protection, supply chain compliance, and enforcement actions. By aligning legal and operational strategies, firms can protect their brands, secure consumer trust, and remain competitive in export markets.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"mb-6\">Bangladesh’s fight against counterfeit medicines is not only about enforcing laws—it is about safeguarding public health and protecting one of the country’s most promising industries. With consistent reforms and active industry collaboration, Bangladesh can move toward a safer, stronger, and more credible pharmaceutical future.</p>\n\n</article>"
